I made this project for my own amusement, it is a password generator that converts alphanumeric strings into variants of the string in the Leet spelling system, you can put your own seed words in Plants.txt or with the gui. Or just run PasswordGenerator.py and put your seed there.
The program converts letters into letters made out of symbols and numbers using the 1337 (Leet) spelling system.

This password:|O /_\ § 5 (/\) () Я |] is pretty hackerproof since brute force can take  forever, more precise 1.000.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 years

You can also encrypt your password with Caesar's Cipher by running Encryptor.py which will run the same GUI.
Check out how the cipher works https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/caesar-cipher-1/problem here

You only need to type your password into the textbox and hit generate password, 
and you'll get a randomly generated password.
